## Glam Up My Markup: Beaches

Use CSS and JavaScript to make the starter HTML markup beautiful, interactive, and useful. We have provided a starter template of a site that lists the best beaches in the world and some information about each one. Since the template does not include photos, you may need to get creative in how you might make it visually appealing.


Your submission should be more fun and interactive than the HTML we provide, but also be usable and accessible. You should not directly edit the HTML provided, unless it is via JavaScript. We expect style and substance. You may add basic boilerplate, including meta tags etc. for presentation purposes.
